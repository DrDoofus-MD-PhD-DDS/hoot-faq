# ShuffleDAO FAQ

## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is the governance body created to promote use of a common currency among NFT communities.
That currency is the DAO's native token, the MINT. The DAO also governs the primary method of introducing MINTs into other NFT communities,
the ShuffleMint NFT Factory.

## What does that mean?
Through the DAO, we hope to encourage use of MINTs across other NFT projects, in lieu of them having to create their own internal currency.
This saves them time and money, as well as, creating built in value for those communities. Ultimately, this also benefits the DAO by adding value to MINTs.
Projects that partner with the DAO, either directly or via ShuffleMint NFT studio, will receive MINTs in return.

## What are MINTs?
MINTs are the native token of ShuffleDAO. MINTs are a free-floating token (not pegged in value to another token). MINTs are backed by ETH at a ratio of 10^6 MINTs per ETH, meaning that for every million MINTs, there is at least 1 ETH in the DAO treasury. The value of the MINT can rise above that ratio, but more MINTs are never minted without backing revenue of 1 ETH per one million MINTs.

## When are MINTs minted?

## What are sMINTs?
MINTs can be staked in return for sMINTs at a 1:1 ratio. When revenue (bonding only?) comes into the DAO, the new value is distributed to sMINT holders via rebasing. That means, ETH comes into the DAO and a number of MINTs are minted. Then sMINTs are minted to return the ratio of MINT to sMINT to 1:1. The new sMINTs are sent to current sMINT holders proprtionally to maintain their current share of DAO value.

## What are veMINTs?
sMINTs can be locked in a contract in return for veMINTs. The ve stands for voting escrow, which means the locked sMINTs are locked into the contract for a predtermined amount of time. In return, the veMINTs gain voting rights in the DAO.

## Auction NFTs
Every day, an NFT is auctioned by the DAO. The winning bidder joins all other NFT auction winners in splitting 25% of all bonding fees. The auction NFT winner also gets a premium on voting rights. An auction NFT win entitles the winner to 10 million veMINTs apart from any other veMINTs the owner possesses.

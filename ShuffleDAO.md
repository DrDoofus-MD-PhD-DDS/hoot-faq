## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is the governance body created to promote use of the DAO's native token, the MINT, as a common currency among NFT communities.
The DAO also governs one of the primary methods of introducing MINTs into other NFT communities, ShuffleMint NFT Studio.

## How will ShuffleDAO achieve its goal?
Through the DAO, we hope to encourage use of MINTs across other NFT projects, in lieu of them having to create their own internal currency or utility token.
This saves them time and money, as well as, creating built in value for those communities. Ultimately, this also benefits the ShuffleDAO by adding value to MINTs.
Projects that partner with the DAO, either directly or via ShuffleMint NFT studio, will receive MINTs in return both for the project itself and the purchasers of their NFTs.

## What is ShuffleMint NFT Studio and how can it help me?
ShuffleMint is a generative art creation utility and contract deployment system that comes with a hands on team ready to assist your NFT project as much or as little as you require. For more information, see the ShuffleMint FAQ.

## What are MINTs?
MINTs are the native token of ShuffleDAO. MINTs are a free-floating token (not pegged in value to another token) that are backed by ETH at a ratio of at most 1 million MINTs per ETH, meaning that for every one million MINTs, there is at least 1 ETH in the DAO treasury. The value of the MINT can rise relative to ETH, but more MINTs are never created without backing revenue of at least 1 ETH per one million. MINTs, or some derivative such as wrapped MINTs, will not only be part of the incentives for partner projects to reward their NFT communities, but will also be rewarded for staking CryptoHoots, purchasing bonds and buying auction NFTs.

## How will the DAO bring in revenue?
ShuffleDAO has several revenue streams:
- Projects that partner with ShuffleMINT NFT Studio will pay ETH into the DAO for use of studio utilities and team member help
- Projects can buy MINTs with ETH directly to use in their communities internal tokenomics
- Daily auction NFTs purchased with ETH to give the buyer governance rights in the DAO and a share of bonding revenue
- Bonds purchased at discounted prices with ETH
- Fees from ownership of the MINT-ETH liquidity pool
- Yield from treasury investment in safe DeFi protocols like Rocket Pool's rETH or AAVE

## When are MINTs minted?
MINT is minted:
- to the purchaser when a bond is purchased
- to the DAO (an additional 25% of the total distributed MINT) when a bond is purchased
- an early auction NFT is sold, bonus MINT is distributed to the winner
- pMINT from team members, contributors, or investors vests

## What flavors of MINTs are there?
ShuffleDAO supports: MINT, sMINT, wsMINT, veMINT, pMINT, and bMINT. Described below.

## What is sMINT and what is rebasing?
MINTs can be staked in return for sMINTs (staked MINTs) at a 1:1 ratio. The reason to stake MINTs (lock them in a contract where you cannot use or trade them), is to allow the staker to share in DAO bonding revenue via rebasing. When ETH from bonds comes into the DAO, a number of MINTs are minted at the current ETH value. For example, if one ETH came into the DAO and MINTs were trading at 1,000 MINTs per ETH, then 1,000 MINTs would be created. sMINTs are then minted in equal amount. The new sMINTs are sent to current sMINT holders proprtionally to maintain their current share of DAO value (if you held 1% of the DAO, you would receive 1% of new sMINTs). This is rebasing. Staked MINTs can be unstaked at any time to receive MINTs, but rebasing will then cease for those MINTs. Without staking, it would be problematic to send new tokens to MINT holders (suppose MINTs were in a liquidity pool or other smart contract, for example). Unless sMINT is sent to early auction NFT winners and pMINT vestings, there will be more MINT than sMINT.


## What is wsMINT?
As noted in the sMINT FAQ above, unstaked tokens are difficult to deal with from a rebasing standpoint. The wsMINT (wrapped sMINT) is a flavor of MINT based on sMINT holdings. The wsMINT is wrapped in the sense that you can borrow against your sMINTs and use the wsMINT external to the DAO ecosystem for other (DeFi, L2, etc.) purposes. An amount of wsMINT can be withdrawn to your wallet in proportion to your sMINT. The ratio of wsMINT to sMINT is time dependent and is called the Wrap Factor. If the Wrap Factor is, for example, 1.5, then number of wsMINTs = 1.5.sMINTs. If the factor is 2 when you wish to return your wsMINTs, you would get wsMINT/2 sMINTs in return. The Wrap Factor is determined from the ratio of value of 1 sMINT from the current time to the origin. So if MINT value now is 500,000 MINT per ETH and in the beginning of the DAO it was 1,000,000 MINT per ETH, the Wrap Factor would be 2. This allows using wsMINTs outside the DAO ecosystem without losing staking rewards while still tracking value versus ETH.

## What is veMINT and how can MINT holders get voting rights?
sMINTs can be locked in a contract in return for veMINTs. The ve stands for voting-escrow, which means the locked sMINTs are locked into the contract for a predtermined amount of time. In return, the veMINTs gain voting rights in the DAO and bond fee sharing for the holder. Note that veMINTs are in addition to sMINTs, not a replacement for them, but they will decay over time. For example, if you stake 1 sMINT for six months at a lock rate of 25%, you will get 0.25 veMINTs which will linearly decay to 0 veMINTs over the six month lock period. At the end, your sMINT would unlock. At any time during the lock period, however, you could re-lock, gaining back maximum veMINTs.

```1 sMINT locked for 2.0 years = 1.00 veMINT
1 sMINT locked for 1.5 years = 0.75 veMINT
1 sMINT locked for 1.0 years = 0.50 veMINT
1 sMINT locked for 0.5 years = 0.25 veMINT
```

Quick Notes
- veMINT can be used in governance voting
- veMINT receives bonding fees
- veMINT is non-transferable
- veMINT decays over time and has no instrinsic value
- veMINT is locked sMINT

## Auction NFTs
Every day, an NFT is auctioned by the DAO. These are candy themed NFTs, not NFTs from the CryptoHoots ecosystem. The winning bidder joins all other NFT auction winners in splitting 25% of all bonding fees. The auction NFT winner also gets a premium on voting rights. An auction NFT win entitles the winner to 10 million veMINTs apart from any other veMINTs the owner possesses. Early auction NFT winners get an early bird MINT bonus. ETH paid for auction NFTs goes into the treasury, but does not trigger MINT creation.

*Questions: Does auction NFT hold special voting privileges. Particularly in regards to ShuffleMint projects? How many MINTs do early auction NFT holders get? Are those distributed as sMINT or veMINT? Do auction NFT veMINT decay?*

## Partner Projects
Partner Projects are other NFT or related communities that require ShuffleMint Studio assistance or other DAO resources for their projects. Partner Projects will pay for the level of software/personnel support they need via special "Project Bonds". These bonds will be paid for in ETH that goes to the treasury. In return, the project will get a percentage of their ETH value back in sMINT. The sMINT will be pooled and rewards will be emitted over time. The project can also take a lump sum MINT allotment. Note that projects that don't need ShuffleMint Studio or other assistance can still simply purchase MINTs from the LP or bonding to use as their own utility token.

*Notes: That section will likely change a bit*

## What are Bonds?
Bonds are IOUs that users may purchase with ETH for the promise of MINTs at a future date. Bonds are sold at a discount from the nominal ETH-MINT price depending on a formula taking into account the DAOs debt ratio and the policy team's need to alter the buy or sell pressure of MINTs. Bonds will vest in a period of five days at which time the number of MINTs will be available to the buyer. Only one bond can be held at a time. Bonds will be sold offering MINTs for ETH and MINTs for ETH-MINT LP tokens. Bonds are also how partner projects will buy into the DAO.


## Who are the DAO members and voters?
Anyone holding MINTs of any flavor is a DAO member.
- sMINT - entitled to rebasing rewards
- veMINT - entitled to voting rights on DAO treasury proposals
- pMINT or auction NFTs - entitled to ShuffleMint governance votes

members and where they get monetary benefits: 
core team/advisors
stakers - bond fees, LP fees, yield, partner projects, auction NFTs (where does ETH coming into 
partners - discounted MINT value + potentially emitted rewards if they pool rather than withdraw MINT allocation
bonders - discounted MINT value
mint holders (includes ecosystem partners) - speculation

ETH/Revenue coming into DAO (does not track, for example, MINT created as fees from bonding):


## Where does DAO Despoited ETH go?
ETH paid


Also buying MINT directly is not net ETH in so isn't here.

Bonding - generates number of MINTs at discounted ETH-MINT value then returned to bond holder (no direct ETH to anyone else, in fact we lose discounted amount of ETH)
auction NFT - generates number of MINTs at current ETH-MINT value then sends 20% as pMINTs to team (core+advisors) and 80% as sMINTs to stakers
partner project - generates number of MINTs at current value, some MINTs returned to project, of remaining 20% to team as pMINT 80% to stakers as sMINT
LP fees - generates number of MINTs at current ETH-MINT value then sends 20% as pMINTs to team (core+advisors) and 80% as sMINTs to stakers
yield fees - generates number of MINTs at current ETH-MINT value then sends 20% as pMINTs to team (core+advisors) and 80% as sMINTs to stakers

Auction NFT + Partner Project ETH all goes to treasury?



## Voting Tiers



## What is Protocol Owned Liquidity?
Once liquidity pools are started, for example on Sushi, the DAO will sell bonds to buy the ETH-MINT LP tokens. Bonds will give a discount making it worthwhile to sell the token. The bond purchaser sells the token for a number of MINTs. When most of the LP tokens are bought by the DAO, it will own its liquidity and collect the fees on trades as another form of revenue.

## How does the CryptoHoots ecosystem fir into the DAO?
CryptoHoot Alpha and Steampunk, CryptoHoot Baby and CyberPunk NFTs can be staked in ShuffleDAO. Staking NFTs from the Hoots ecosystem will get the staker a shared percent of the bonding fees. It is possible that staking a Hoot will get you an L2 NFT as escrow for your staked hoots and that it might mirror the hoot in some form by virtue of the on-chain DNA.

- CryptoHoots and Alphas - 10%
- Babies - 2%
- CyberPunk - 3%


## What IV (Initial Value)?
Initial Value is the value of MINT per ETH that we start with. We seed the liquidity pool and offer initial purchases with this value in mind. ShuffleDAO will begin with an IV of 4x Intrinsic Value. Intrinsic value is the minimum backing of MINT per ETH. ShuffleDAO intrinsic value is one million MINTs per ETH and at 4xIV, initial value is 250,000 MINTs per ETH. When ETH value is around $4000 USD, that gives a rough estimate of one MINT per US cent.

## How does the core team get paid?
Core team, advisors, contributors and project partners get paid in private MINTs, pMINTs. These are MINTs that vest to regular MINTs over time and/or under conditions of DAO treasury fund goals.

# ShuffleDAO FAQ

## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is the governance body created to promote use of a common currency among NFT communities.
That currency is the DAO's native token, the MINT. The DAO also governs the primary method of introducing MINTs into other NFT communities,
the ShuffleMint NFT Factory.

## What does that mean?
Through the DAO, we hope to encourage use of MINTs across other NFT projects, in lieu of them having to create their own internal currency.
This saves them time and money, as well as, creating built in value for those communities. Ultimately, this also benefits the DAO by adding value to MINTs.
Projects that partner with the DAO, either directly or via ShuffleMint NFT studio, will receive MINTs in return.

## What are MINTs?
MINTs are the native token of ShuffleDAO. MINTs are a free-floating token (not pegged in value to another token). MINTs are backed by ETH at a ratio of 10^6 MINTs per ETH, meaning that for every million MINTs, there is at least 1 ETH in the DAO treasury. The value of the MINT can rise above that ratio, but more MINTs are never minted without backing revenue of 1 ETH per one million MINTs.

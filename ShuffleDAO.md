# ShuffleDAO FAQ
Note that the information in this FAQ is preliminary and subject to change

## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is the governance body created to promote use of the DAO's native token, the MINT, as a common currency among NFT communities.
The DAO also governs the primary method of introducing MINTs into other NFT communities, ShuffleMint NFT Studio.

## How will ShuffleDAO achieve its goal?
Through the DAO, we hope to encourage use of MINTs across other NFT projects, in lieu of them having to create their own internal currency.
This saves them time and money, as well as, creating built in value for those communities. Ultimately, this also benefits the DAO by adding value to MINTs.
Projects that partner with the DAO, either directly or via ShuffleMint NFT studio, will receive MINTs in return.

## What are MINTs?
MINTs are the native token of ShuffleDAO. MINTs are a free-floating token (not pegged in value to another token) that are backed by ETH at a ratio of 1 million MINTs per ETH, meaning that for every million MINTs, there is at least 1 ETH in the DAO treasury. The value of the MINT can rise above that ratio, but more MINTs are never created without backing revenue of 1 ETH per one million. MINTs, or some derivative such as wrapped MINTs, will not only be part of the incentives for partner projects to reward their NFT communities, but also will be rewarded for staking CryptoHoots, purchasing bonds and buying auction NFTs.

## How will the DAO bring in revenue?
ShuffleDAO has several revenue streams:
Projects that partner with ShuffleMINT NFT Studio will pay ETH into the DAO for use of studio utilities and team member help
Projects can buy MINTs with ETH directly to use in their communities internal tokenomics
Daily auction NFTs purchased with ETH to give the buyer governance rights in the DAO
Bonds purchased at discounted prices with ETH
Fees from ownership of the MINT-ETH liquidity pool 

## When are MINTs minted?
MINT is minted when:
a change in treasury funds prompts rebasing for MINT stakers
a bond is purchased, MINT is distributed to the buyer
a bond is purchased, an additional 25% of the total distributed MINT is minted for the DAO
pMINT from team members, contributors, or investors vests
an early auction NFT is sold, bonus MINT is distributed to the winner

## What is sMINT?
MINTs can be staked in return for sMINTs at a 1:1 ratio. When revenue (bonding only?) comes into the DAO, the new value is distributed to sMINT holders via rebasing. That means, ETH comes into the DAO and a number of MINTs are minted. Then sMINTs are minted to return the ratio of MINT to sMINT to 1:1. The new sMINTs are sent to current sMINT holders proprtionally to maintain their current share of DAO value.

## What is wsMINT?

## What is veMINT?
sMINTs can be locked in a contract in return for veMINTs. The ve stands for voting-escrow, which means the locked sMINTs are locked into the contract for a predtermined amount of time. In return, the veMINTs gain voting rights in the DAO. Note that veMINTs are in addition to the locked sMINTs, not a replacement for them, but they will decay over time. For example, if you stake 1 sMINT for six months at a lock rate of 10%, you will get 0.1 veMINTs which will linearly decay to 0 veMINTs over the six month lock period. At the end, your sMINT would unlock. At any time during the lock persiod, however, you could re-lock, gaining back maximum veMINTs.

## Auction NFTs
Every day, an NFT is auctioned by the DAO. The winning bidder joins all other NFT auction winners in splitting 25% of all bonding fees. The auction NFT winner also gets a premium on voting rights. An auction NFT win entitles the winner to 10 million veMINTs apart from any other veMINTs the owner possesses.

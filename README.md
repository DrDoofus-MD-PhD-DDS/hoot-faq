# ShuffleDAO
What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is the governance body created to promote use of a common currency among NFT communities.
That currency is the DAOs native token, the MINT.

What does that mean?
Through the DAO, we hope to encourage use of MINTs among other NFT projects, in lieu of them having to create their own internal currency.
This saves them time and money, as well as, creating value in that token amongst communities. Ultimately, this also benefits the DAO by adding value to MINTs
which are held by DAO members.
